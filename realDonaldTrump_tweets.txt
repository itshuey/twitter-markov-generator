There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent, Fake, or Corrupt! When the ‚ÄúAge of Trump‚Äù is looked back on many years from now, I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!
The  Amazon Washington Post and @CNN just did a Fake Interview on Pardons for Aids on the Wall, and that I didn‚Äôt think the Wall on the Southern Border was that important to stop Illegals wanting to come into our Country. WRONG, vitally important. Will make a BIG impact. So bad!
A sad day for the Democrats, Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. I‚Äôm glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!
Thank you for the support as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/qKgwRMSgcf
Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly), I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!
The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress, and elsewhere! https://t.co/12tIW3aNQP https://t.co/2nFIEFppho
....And by the way, I‚Äôm the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to Puerto Rico!
Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!....
Our Federal Reserve cannot ‚Äúmentally‚Äù keep up with the competition - other countries. At the G-7 in France, all of the other Leaders were giddy about how low their Interest Costs have gone. Germany is actually ‚Äúgetting paid‚Äù to borrow money - ZERO INTEREST PLUS! No Clue Fed!
....I don‚Äôt want to Win for myself, I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isn‚Äôt working for us anymore!

Just watched @FoxNews heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director, spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor, @SandraSmithFox. Terrible considering that Fox couldn‚Äôt even land a debate, the Dems give them NOTHING! @CNN &amp; @MSNBC....
Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain‚Äôs Labour Party, to seek a no-confidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson, especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, &amp; will prove to be ‚Äúa great one!‚Äù Love U.K.
We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready,  and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!
So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China, from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - In fact, they got taken to the cleaners. We are doing very well with China. This has never happened to them before!
‚ÄúThe infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times office‚Äù @OANN  was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens, a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do! He is now quitting Twitter after being called a ‚Äúbedbug.‚Äù Tough guy!

Can you believe it? I‚Äôm at 94% approval in the Republican Party, and have Three Stooges running against me. One is ‚ÄúMr. Appalachian Trail‚Äù who was actually in Argentina for bad reasons....
Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE, let‚Äôs see, what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said, ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt we say he wants to bomb a hurricane, that should do it!‚Äù The media in our Country is totally out of control!
They do stories so big on Elizabeth ‚ÄúPocahontas‚Äù Warren‚Äôs crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!
It is amazing that I can be at 51% with Zogby when the Fake &amp; Corrupt News is almost 100% against me. Great job Mr. President!
The G7 in France was so successful, and yet when I came back and read the Corrupt and Fake News, and watched numerous networks, it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the Great G7 event!

The G-7 was a great success for the USA and all. LameStream Media coverage bore NO relationship to what actually happened in France - FAKE NEWS. It was GREAT!
No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats, upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7, spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!
Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly &amp; works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!
I have gotten to know President @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with Brazil. He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!
Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G-7, only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous, never happened!

So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the U.S., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History, very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....
My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!
.....We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate, and we should be lower than them. Yesterday, ‚Äúhighest Dollar in U.S.History.‚Äù No inflation. Wake up Federal Reserve. Such growth potential, almost like never before!
Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. He‚Äôs like a golfer who can‚Äôt putt, has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing, BIG CUT - but don‚Äôt count on him! So far he has called it wrong, and only let us down....
The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the ‚Äúcreate‚Äù a U.S. recession, even though the numbers &amp; facts are working totally in the opposite direction. They would be willing to hurt many people, but that doesn‚Äôt matter to them. Our Economy is sooo strong, sorry!
‚ÄúThe speed bump has been missteps by the Federal Reserve.‚Äù @cvpayne  @foxandfriends  So true!
Rep Tlaib wants to cut off aid to Israel. This is the new face the of Democrat Party? Read the AOC PLUS 3 statements on their hatred of Jews and Israel. Check out Rep. Omar (the great people of Minnesota won‚Äôt stand for this).
Brandon Judd, President, National Border Patrol Council. ‚ÄúThis will effectively end Catch and Release and curb illegal entries.‚Äù
.....all Jews, Blacks, Gays, everyone. And importantly, he‚Äôs good for everyone in America who wants a job.‚Äù Wow!  @newsmax  @foxandfriends @OANN
....like he‚Äôs the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God...But American Jews don‚Äôt know him or like him. They don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that‚Äôs OK, if he keeps doing what he‚Äôs doing, he‚Äôs good for.....
‚ÄúThank you to Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him....
....The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!
Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen‚Äôs comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time....

Great discussion with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson today. We talked about Brexit and how we can move rapidly on a US-UK free trade deal. I look forward to meeting with Boris this weekend, at the @G7, in France!

.....The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!
Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to ‚Äúwill‚Äù the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election.  Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world...

Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable ‚Äúnut job‚Äù who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked, &amp; then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on TV. Abused staff,...
