One of my favorite of many things about what the Trump hat represents to me is that people can’t tell me what to do because I’m black
Spoke with Joe Rogan    Podcast coming soon🔥🔥🔥
From now on I’m performing with my mutherfucking hat on 🐉🐉🐉

2019 we going in     Always remember we did five albums in a row       I love making music     We always feel the love
Love everyone
If something’s on my mind and spirit I let it out
Tweeting is legal and also therapeutic
See when you care about your family you don’t let no man push you to do nothing that could risk your freedom
If I got any cooler I would freeze to death
I ain’t never followed anyone else’s methods     I ain’t trying to be cool
Or it’s cool if it’s a diss record because it’s more entertaining? Ima break all codes. I ain’t taking advice from no one who ain’t do nothing to actually help
I only play by God’s rules. I don’t follow no man made codes

We feel the love
Everything happens for a reason
2019 we’re already so thankful for the blessings in order
Refresh
New designs new music new ideas renewed spirit we changing everything everyday the vision is crystal
I feel stronger than ever    We are stronger than ever
We feel soooo much love. So much good energy. So much good will
I’m drug free and my spirit is connected. No weapon formed against us shall prosper
I got to be myself and nobody had to “let me”
2018 was so beautiful
We’re super happy
My dad got me a drone for Christmas 🔥🔥🔥

Bob Dylan
If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I would’ve let it slide
If I’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died
I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the risin’ star, Its up to me
Met with Trav at my crib this morning   We expressed ourselves    It’s all love
https://t.co/f0QyccE0T6
I will put this in question form     Who has heard of the twelve lost tribes of Judah?  Have you heard that two of the tribes were actually black? 🤔
WE FREE
We free
I love that we are destigmitizing mental health     Gucciman and Quavo have a song Bipolar this is so good for culture
I’m loving the new music I’ve been working on. 6 months off meds I can feel me again.   Remember when dark fantasy came out I used to tweet a storm also.
Keep squares out yo circle
There was a handler with me at TMZ a so called voice of reason that thank the lord no longer is in my circle
I have no more handlers     Only fear god
I give up drinking every week
You don’t make runaway on medication      Even alcohol is and addictive substance called spirits that actually block our earthly connection to our spirit when we drown ourselves in it
I cannot be on meds and make watch the throne level or dark fantasy level music
God has given me this voice for a reason
Perhaps we stop looking at my tweets as rants and start looking at them as therapy testimonials and some even ministry
Man makes plans and god laughs
I need to speak about how Chance demanding that we record in Chicago reconnected me with my roots and also my faith in Jesus Christ
You have to see and feel how happy I am and how strong my family is. We are even stronger because of this through the love and grace of god
People said my career was over after TMZ       I need to show the world that we so called crazy people will not be just written off
I’ve been trying to do a serious interview speaking on mental health but it seems as though all members of press are afraid to speak to someone who has been diagnosed but is still everyone’s favorite super hero
RT @JaidaRaymond: Thank u for being you, goat @kanyewest 💜💜💜
People try to ‘handle you when they think you have a mental problem
We as a society are taking control of our consciousness and raising it together
The paradigm is shifting
We love
Drake and Trav both love Ye more than anyone and I love those guys back. We love everyone
We’re all growing together
It’s like when you see a tv show from the 60s and it’s super racist and sexist
It reminds me of when I said stop hip hop homophobia      It used to be ok for rappers to bash gay people just listen to certain rap records from the 90s and early 2000s
I don’t blame people for not knowing how to handle this that said we as a society will learn together
I am able to experience first hand how people who have mental health issues get written off by society.    Don’t listen to him cause he’s crazy. He’s washed cause he’s crazy etc...
No one would ever choose to end up in a mental hospital and diagnosed with a mental disorder but god chose me to publicly go through this journey and it is beautiful
Drake verbally attacked Cudi when he was in the hospital and went at me after TMZ because I decided to release albums in June   Is snowballed and he refused to meet with me but texted my mother in law and did sneak disses on peoples records that I consider family
People will no longer take mental health for a joke

Meditate in positivity
All love
All positive vibes
I’ve made mistakes and have karma   No man is perfect     The universe will test us
I’m a man about my family and integrity
Broke down doors for sneakers fashion music everything
No artist should ever diss me for clout   Period
I need that love and respect that we didn’t give Michael while I’m alive
If I wasn’t here all artist would do memorial songs
If I wasn’t hear all artist would be doing memorial songs
I actually like sickomode but I don’t like that that is was sneak disses
Love to all artist
I love everybody all positive energy    No one that is a musician should ever diss me     My existence is for the rights of all artist
All positive energy   I got love for everyone     Just don’t sneak diss or diss at all    I paid the dues for all weirdos
I have a problem with sneak disssing
I hit Trav earlier today    Now he just hit me    More threats
Drake called me threatening me
It’s not about rap     It’s about family   We have to be close as a family and never let these people infiltrate just for radio spins
Family first
Fuck clout
Fuck that sickomode song        Family first and always
It’s what I felt   And have been feeling for awhile   All positive   All love
Perhaps I should have been more like water today
All positive energy
We should all be on this planet working together
https://t.co/kdorJkJJqE
Trying to kick me while I’m down
Our brother is lost and confused
If Drake would go at Ye that there is interviews that he loves me then he doesn’t give a fuck about anyone
You tried to hurt my pockets
You threatened the safety of me and my family
Noooooo moooooore fake playing with peoples lives kids and mental health
Noooooooo moooooore cap
He passes Drakes the crib everyday
To the right    It’s   On sight     Saint stays to the right
This clout shit done got outta hand bro
Trav is my family and let this met throw sneak disses at me for clout
I heard Drake had more bars dissing me that were removed
I used to bring Travis with me everywhere with me    Im an inspiration to both him and Drake
Only positive energy
I will never put negative energy into a song
I will never make a diss record
You’re mad at me for something I didn’t do
