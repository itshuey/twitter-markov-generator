@JaneidyEve @flcnhvy @Freiraum77 @SpaceX Aiming for 20km flight in Oct &amp; orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept 28th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time.
@flcnhvy @Freiraum77 @SpaceX Probably 2 to 3 months. We‚Äôre about to ship Raptor SN 10.

Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes
@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system‚Äôs fusion reactor (the sun).
@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
@ThePhoenixFlare Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming
